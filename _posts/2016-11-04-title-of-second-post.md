Sharks belong to a family of fish that have skeletons made of cartilage, a
tissue more flexible and lighter than bone. They breathe through a series of
five to seven gill slits located on either side of their bodies. All sharks have
multiple rows of teeth, and while they lose teeth on a regular basis, new teeth
continue to grow in and replace those they lose.

Shark ‘skin’ is made up of a series of scales that act as an outer skeleton for
easy movement and for saving energy in the water. The upper side of a shark is
generally dark to blend in with the water from above and their undersides are
white or lighter colored to blend in with the lighter surface of the sea from
below. This helps to camouflage them from predators and prey.
